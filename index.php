        <p>I'm Colin Videlock, a full stack web developer. Check out my resume <a href="/cv_assets/extra/Colin_Videlock_2020_resume.pdf">here</a> or alternatively, download my resume <a href="/cv_assets/extra/Colin_Videlock_2020_resume.docx">here!</a></p>
        <p>I've been a developer at various jobs spanning roughly 5 years. Prior to that I had completed a Bachelor of Science from Rochester Institute of Technology in a 5 year program, and gained an Associates degree from Suffolk County Community College on Long Island.</p>
        <p>From my years in the field I've gained a lot of experience in backend, and frontend programming. My main programming languages are in PHP, HTML, CSS (CSS3, as well as LESS and SCSS/SASS), JavaScript, and JQuery. I've learned a lot about websites and how a user interacts with different portions of both the client side and the admin side, and what each needs. This gives me a unique position in UI development, as well as design.</p>
        <p>My main code editor of choice is currently Visual Studio Code, I have worked in Flash CS5, Microsoft Visual Studio, Photoshop, and Unity. I also have had minor experience in Maya, and Illustrator. My github account is <a href="https://github.com/spectralshadow514"> Spectralshadow514 </a> and my bitbucket account is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Spectralshadow">Spectralshadow</a>, you can find me on IRC under the nick Spectralshadow as well.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy hiking, working on and building computers, watching youtube, and playing video games (ask me my total level on runescape, or my favorite raid from destiny!)</p>
        <p>Find me interesting? Contact me <a href="mailto:colinvidelock@gmail.com">through my email,</a> or send me a message on my <a href="/contact/">contact page</a></p>
