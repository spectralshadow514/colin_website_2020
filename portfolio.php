              <p>My first big web project. It was a collaborative idea to get rid of food waste without much hassle for the end user. The idea was to create an app that knew the contents of your fridge using RFID technology, by utilizing a scanner in your fridge everyday items would be scanned and pushed to a database that would know what you've had in the fridge and for what amount of time it's been in there. Using that data you could know approximate times of expirations to cut down on food waste, while also having the ability to suggest recipes based on what's in there. Also since it was an app, you could check the contents of your fridge while out at the store.</p>
              <p>My role in the project was building a couple of the web pages which was my first real experience building a website, grabbing data from an api and outputting specialized content. It was a fun and hard project that really opened my eyes to just how powerful a simple idea can be.</p>

            <p>My first official website at a company. It was tough, as the work environment was both new and difficult, a lot of work was done through the CMS but some of it had to be done through SQL, which was nerve wracking. The designer was also stricter on pixel perfectness on his designs, so it really helped with learning how margins, padding and borders really worked without the use of bootstrap.</p>

            <p>Created a filter, and filled out the attractions, for all the parks on the Jolly Roger sites. This was a larger undertaking as it was a similar, but different, filter per park as each one had different requirements for each ride. It took a bit of enginuity and wordpress knowledge to get it right.</p>

            <p>A fun idea for a college, where we went through and moved all of their documentation over onto the website and needed to keep the theme consistent between pages. Fortunately the inner page styles were simple enough to keep the formats from breaking too much.</p>

            <p>An initially ambitious rehaul of their admittedly meager website they had won a competition for. There were talks of creating some crazy javascript portions, like donation trackers. Unfortunately we never made it that far, but what we did do has helped them a lot and we had many thanks from them.</p>

            <p>A website designed by the company that contacted us. Every page had a completely different design, but with the same background and colors. It was a long and difficult site, but eventually was launched. Later on they eventually wanted something different and unfortunately decided to go in house with their project.</p>

            <p>200Deep ended up being a project in turmoil, the owner of the company switched web companies multiple times within 2 years, finishing with using half our design, but using a new company. The design itself was a bit of a crazy angled idea, which caused a lot of issues cross browser. It was a lot of fun to make each section work correctly while also making sure each browser and device could handle it.</p>
