                <p>I have always been into computers, which helped grow my love of coding when I started in college. Some of my favorite courses included a Free and Open Source Software course, design classes, and the Web Tech courses. </p>

        <p>My first job at BX3 Interactive I was quickly pushed into many new environments, and learned a lot about how a company runs the hard way. We had an intense designer, who was very pixel-perfect oriented. In that same job we used a mainly custom CMS that seemed to be based of an early version of joomla, it hid many of it's bigger content in the SQL which gave me a lot of experience searching and using SQL for displaying and changing content.</p>
        <p> that Techno Goober I worked in a small team as the main developer. We used an agile development environment to facilitate projects and move them along quickly.</p>
        <p> and I completed a five year course program at Rochester Institute of Technology where I earned a Bachelors of Science in New Media Interactive Development, and I graduated from Suffolk County Community College with an Associates in Computer Art.</p>
        <p>I have had a lot of experience building websites and working on computers. My main skills are in PHP, SQL, CSS, and HTML, and I've had experience in XML, AS3, Python, and C#.</p>
        <p>My latest and biggest project to date was my senior project, <a href="http://savory.cias.rit.edu/">Savory</a> of which we won a <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/sponsor_awards_2014.php">bronze sponsorship award</a></p>
